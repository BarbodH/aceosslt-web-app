    title: "A Huge Mural Marks a Graffiti Philosophy in Montreal",
    date: "March 2015, Section I Reading",
    passageText: "They are graffiti artists. They spray-paint buildings. And they are paid by taxpayers. Their latest work, Our Lady of Grace, unveiled in November 2011, transformed a dingy, beige brick wall in Montreal's west end into a six-storey canvas that hundreds now stop to admire. While Montreal can be tough on illegal graffiti and tagging, the city has developed a relationship with graffiti artists, who are adamant that their genre is legitimate. “It's the same as a paintbrush, and we are showing our talent,” said the artist who only gave his name as Fluke.\nBeginning in 2006, Montreal budgeted $1.2 million to attack the problem of graffiti. That includes about $150,000 for murals. The Our Lady of Grace fresco cost the city $26 000 and took 400 cans of spray paint to complete. The mural shows the lady in a flowing robe, surrounded by scenes of the urban landscape and reminders—such as Caribbean birds—of the multicultural character of the area. New murals are going up regularly in Montreal. In August and September 2011, walls honouring singer, songwriter and actor Raymond Levesque and jazz artist Oscar Peterson went up. “We turn an energy that might be negative into one that's positive,” said an executive from the mayor's office.\nStill, Fluke worries about his art form. Old factories are turning into condos. Politicians crack down looking for votes. “Graffiti as a subculture is growing dramatically, but we have less space to do it. [Murals] like this allow our voice to be heard,” he said.",

    passageText: "Ice sculpting has been called a “spart”—part sport, part art. Like athletes, ice sculptors vie for medals at international competitions. Ice carving has been a Cultural Olympiad event at the Olympic and Paralympic Arts Festival since the 1988 Calgary Winter Games. The tools and the ice are heavy, so sculptors need endurance and strength. “It's physically demanding working non-stop under a time constraint,” says Dan Rebholtz, who has been carving for 22 years. He is a veteran of 100 competitions, a three-time world champion and a certified judge with the National Ice Carving Association. Most North American ice carvers have art training. Their tools include chainsaws, carving chisels, electrical sanders and torches, but most important, an imagination. “Our favourite word is 'wow,'” says Rebholtz. It's the word most people say when they see sculptures such as <em>Surfacing Kingfisher</em> by the team of Junichi Nakamura (Japan) and Suguru Kanbayashi (Canada). Although ice sculptures are beautiful and their creation time-consuming, carvers must accept the potential for tragedy and the certainty of impermanence for their masterpieces. Melting can be a threat, but so too is crashing. Nakamura's team, which included Rebholtz, worked almost 20 hours a day for six days on <em>The Birth of the Bluebird</em>, a gigantic sculpture of a reclining woman, her arm reaching up to a bird. Just before the judging, it toppled, when its last supporting pillar was cut—a spectacle viewed over 10 000 times on YouTube. Sport? Art? With its challenge, skill, beauty and risk, ice carving is both",

    title: "A Stunning Comeback to an Elite Sport",
    date: "March 2014, Section IV Reading",
    passageText: "The official line on Marie-Eve Chainey in the women's high jump read \“NH\”—shorthand for \“No Height\”—not exactly a fitting designation for an athlete who truly soared.\n For some athletes at the Canadian track and field championships in August 2010, a triumphant return meant posting fast times after a slow season. For Chainey, it meant returning to elite competition after a nine-year battle with kidney disease. Three years ago, she was unable to walk and even lacked the strength to wash her hair.\n As a 14-year-old, Chainey would often travel 820 kilometres from Kapuskasing to Toronto to train under coach Gary Lubin at York University. At 18, Chainey went to Spain to learn the language and continue her high-jump training. While there, she became so dizzy she had to be hospitalized. That's when she got the news: Her kidneys were no longer working. She hasn't known life without dialysis since.\n Healthy kidneys filter waste products from the blood. In dialysis treatment, a machine cleans the blood at regular intervals, for example, three times a week. Chainey has been using nocturnal dialysis, which works while she sleeps.\n Since her original diagnosis, Chainey has had to overcome four relapses and countless other obstacles, including going blind for two months. She was told over and over she'd never jump again because her muscles were too damaged. But for Chainey, jumping is like breathing.\n \“From when I got sick, the goal that I had was to just be back jumping,\” she said. \“Jumping was basically my happy place. Even now more so. Because I'm sick and there's so much going on, when I go to high jump, I don't think about anything else than just high jump and enjoying it. It is definitely my getaway. I feel normal because I don't have to think about anything else.\”\n"
    + "So on the eve of the national championships, the 27-year-old was not about to be deterred by a difficult night of dialysis. \“I'm very stubborn, I'm very hard-headed ... I just had to find a way that I would be able to jump, no matter what.\”\n Chainey certainly felt jitters at the championships; her hands wouldn't stop shaking once the competition began. She didn't clear the starting height of 1.50 metres, which she had managed to get over in practice. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a happier last-place finisher anywhere.\n \“Just being out there, especially when they lined us up and they introduced us to the crowd, it was a special moment that I'll always remember,\” she said. \“I didn't feel comfortable at first because I didn't feel I belonged. But although I didn't get a height, I still feel I belonged there. It felt awesome just to have the opportunity and experience this.\”\n Chainey says kidney disease has cured her of her perfectionism. \“I've always been a straight A student, always done well in sports and piano,\” she said. \“So when I got sick, my life wasn't perfect anymore. I had to learn how to live with what you have, that I had limits. That was a very good lesson for me, to know that things aren't always perfect but you can still make the best of it.\”\n Lubin is not surprised by her determination. “She used to come down from Kapuskasing, a 12-hour train ride ... in order to train. When I talk to my athletes about dedication, I say, ‘Don't tell me you came from Burlington. You think that's far? How about Kapuskasing?' This is the type of person she is.\”\n There are comebacks, and there are <em>comebacks</em>.",

    title: "An Animator from Scarborough",
    date: "April 2013, Section I Reading",
    passageText: "Over 1500 applications from around the world flood George Lucas's animation academy each year (Lucas created the Star Wars films), but only four applicants are selected for internships. Randolph Lizarda, 21, from Scarborough, was one of them. “I'm very excited. I'll be working in the LucasArts division animating video games, although I don't know what we're working on. They wouldn't tell me—it's confidential,” Lizarda said on a break from his Sheridan College class. As a child, Lizarda liked to draw cartoons. Now he is learning to transfer his drawing ability to the computer. “I was into [art] when I was little; then I got more into it in high school. In Grade 10, I took one of those career surveys to find out where you fit in. I fit into the animation industry,” he said. Lizarda aspires to one day work for an animation company such as Pixar or DreamWorks. “He's an excellent student,” said Dave Quesnelle, who teaches animation and is one of Lizarda's professors. Lizarda stood out after handing in his first assignment, a 10-second action sequence of a muscular circus performer balancing on a ball before jumping through a hoop of fire. This clip was the first segment on the demo reel he submitted to Lucasfilm. “I had a really good sense of his storytelling. He had the basic principles of animation [but] it was also comical. And that's our job. Anyone can make a picture move, but to make it entertaining, that's the craft of an animator.”",

    title: "Practical Woman Donned It First",
    date: "May 2013, Section III Reading",
    passageText: "On page 25 of the <em>Hockey News</em> is a black-and-white photograph of my grandmother, wearing goalie pads and a striped hockey sweater. The article describes how, while playing for Queen's University in 1927, my grandmother shocked fans by wearing a mask.\n \“The first hockey netminder interested in saving face looks to have been Elizabeth Graham,\” the article reads. \“It would appear the father of the goalie mask was in fact a woman.\”\n Annie Elizabeth Graham grew up in Arnprior, in the Ottawa Valley. At Queen's University, she joined the ladies' hockey team. A photo taken at the time shows her team horsing around on outdoor ice, wearing their jerseys and wool bloomers, looking like they're having a blast.\n Hockey players didn't even wear helmets back then, but on February 7, 1927, she stepped onto the ice wearing a metal mask. The <em>Kingston Whig-Standard</em> noted how she \“gave the fans a surprise,\” but the newspaper conceded her good sense. \“It was safety first with her,\” it said. It was actually a fencing mask and she wore it to protect her teeth. Her father had already spent so much to send her to university that she didn't want to add to his burden by racking up dental bills.\n Three years after her masked debut, Clint Benedict of the Montreal Maroons, after stopping too many pucks with his face, wore a leather mask in a game against the New York Rangers. It wasn't until the 1950s, however, that National Hockey League (NHL) goalies started seriously experimenting with masks, led by the legendary Jacques Plante.\n <em>Legends</em>, the Hockey Hall of Fame's official program, claims that when it comes to goaltender masks, Elizabeth Graham truly was \“the mother of invention.\” But she was not widely credited for it because women's hockey was just not that popular in the 1920s, drawing only about 1000 fans to places like the Montreal Forum, which had a seating capacity of 9300 then.\n Like a lot of innovators, my grandmother passed away before she was recognized for her contribution. Her role as the pioneer of the goalie mask was always family legend, but she is now getting her due. The Hockey Hall of Fame has named her one of a dozen \“Notable Women Hockey Players,\” and she is featured in a new book called <em>Saving Face: The Art and History of the Goalie Mask</em>.\n"
    + "During the 2004 NHL lockout, a reader wrote to <em>Toronto Sun</em> columnist Earl McRae, asking him to settle the question over whether Benedict or Plante was the first goalie to wear a mask. \“You're both wrong,\” Mr. McRae wrote, explaining how my grandmother had used a mask long before either goalie.\n Grandma would have laughed at that. She had a great big laugh that could fill a house. She was a spirited lady, a teacher by profession. She embodied the traits of strength, confidence and prudence. When we were kids, she wouldn't even let us go swimming in Marshall Bay until an hour after lunch because we might get cramps and drown. And in sport, she felt compelled to shield her teeth from flying pucks.\n I'm not a goalie, but I love the sport. My weekends begin at 6:30 a.m. in the dressing room of a suburban arena where I sip coffee and pull on toxic-smelling hockey equipment for a friendly game of dark shirts against light shirts. I wear a helmet—with a mask. On a recent Saturday, I asked my teammates whether they'd seen the latest <em>Hockey News</em>. \“My grandma's in there,\” I said as we laced up. There aren't very many guys who can say that.",
