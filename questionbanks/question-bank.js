    title: "An Animator from Scarborough",
    passageText: "Over 1500 applications from around the world flood George Lucas's animation academy each year (Lucas created the Star Wars films), but only four applicants are selected for internships. Randolph Lizarda, 21, from Scarborough, was one of them. “I'm very excited. I'll be working in the LucasArts division animating video games, although I don't know what we're working on. They wouldn't tell me—it's confidential,” Lizarda said on a break from his Sheridan College class. As a child, Lizarda liked to draw cartoons. Now he is learning to transfer his drawing ability to the computer. “I was into [art] when I was little; then I got more into it in high school. In Grade 10, I took one of those career surveys to find out where you fit in. I fit into the animation industry,” he said. Lizarda aspires to one day work for an animation company such as Pixar or DreamWorks. “He's an excellent student,” said Dave Quesnelle, who teaches animation and is one of Lizarda's professors. Lizarda stood out after handing in his first assignment, a 10-second action sequence of a muscular circus performer balancing on a ball before jumping through a hoop of fire. This clip was the first segment on the demo reel he submitted to Lucasfilm. “I had a really good sense of his storytelling. He had the basic principles of animation [but] it was also comical. And that's our job. Anyone can make a picture move, but to make it entertaining, that's the craft of an animator.”",

    title: "A Huge Mural Marks a Graffiti Philosophy in Montreal",
    date: "March 2015, Section I Reading",
    passageText: "[1] They are graffiti artists. They spray-paint buildings. And they are paid by taxpayers. Their latest work, Our Lady of Grace, unveiled in November 2011, transformed a dingy, beige brick wall in Montreal's west end into a six-storey canvas that hundreds now stop to admire. While Montreal can be tough on illegal graffiti and tagging, the city has developed a relationship with graffiti artists, who are adamant that their genre is legitimate. “It's the same as a paintbrush, and we are showing our talent,” said the artist who only gave his name as Fluke.\n[2] Beginning in 2006, Montreal budgeted $1.2 million to attack the problem of graffiti. That includes about $150 000 for murals. The Our Lady of Grace fresco cost the city $26 000 and took 400 cans of spray paint to complete. The mural shows the lady in a flowing robe, surrounded by scenes of the urban landscape and reminders—such as Caribbean birds—of the multicultural character of the area. New murals are going up regularly in Montreal. In August and September 2011, walls honouring singer, songwriter and actor Raymond Levesque and jazz artist Oscar Peterson went up. “We turn an energy that might be negative into one that's positive,” said an executive from the mayor's office.\n[3] Still, Fluke worries about his art form. Old factories are turning into condos. Politicians crack down looking for votes. “Graffiti as a subculture is growing dramatically, but we have less space to do it. [Murals] like this allow our voice to be heard,” he said.",
